# ComputerGuesser1
Attempts to guess a number in some range in the fewest possible attempts.
This is done by calling the function with a lower and upper limit specified. Then a random number is drawn from the range specified. The computer guesses the midpoint of your given range to start, then procedurally shrinks the range based on your guess being too low or too high and guesses the midpoint again until the guess is correct.
